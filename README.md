# Autoclicker
This is a project I made when working on Bithoven (https://github.com/JoDev00/Bithoven)! 
# Disclaimer
This is for educational / fun purposes only. I heavily discourage the use of this program in any circumstance other than learning.
# Features
- Adjustable hold time, if you need to simulate button holds
- Press delay, for cases where you might need to delay the time in between button presses, or the intial button press
# Lore
This autoclicker is very fast for python, I've tried it on two click speed test sites and it froze both with how fast it was. 
I'd recommend adjusting the delay to be something reasonable (perhaps 0.01 or something, which is still overkill)
